## Requirements
This code base heavily relies on [pytorch implementation of StyleGAN2](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch) and [MixDL](https://github.com/reyllama/mixdl). We have mainly tested on 

```
- python=3.6.12
- torch=1.4.0
- CUDA=10.1
```
## Training

```bash
$ python3 rcl.py
```
